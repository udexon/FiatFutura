- Fiat Futura. We are Futurists. We create the Future.

The Start-Up business has become so sophisticated over the past century that almost every conceivable tactic has been attempted. However, we believe we are going to be different, again.

We are going to combine the free and open source software model, together with training and education, YouTube video making and Influencers social networks, to make a Start-Up network that can literally benefit anyone from 5 years old to 75 years old.

We are calling it FiatFutura because we believe creating the future is the one cause that can unite talents from all walks of life, from around the world.

Who are the stakeholders and what are the benefits?

- Non-programmers or novice programmers: learn programming
- Expert programmers: recruit collaborators and apprentice (voluntary or incentivised)
- Influencers: get latest ideas about technological innovations, make video blogs
- Novice video bloggers: get to know expert influencers and learn directly from experts 
- Investors: get tried and tested team of developers and published video blogs
